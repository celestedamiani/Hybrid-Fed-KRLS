# Hybrid Federated Kernel Regularized Least Squares


## Overview
This repository contains the code used in: [[1]](#1). The project provides a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the algorithm **FedCG** in a simulated federated implementation, along with the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. We also provide the code to carry out the performance tests. Moreover, in `EDM_tests/` we report the Matlab code used for the experiments of Euclidean Distance Matrice (EDM) reconstruction that we carried out to test the efficiency of FedCG in protecting the EDM of the dataset points for different cardinalities of Nystrom landmarks sets.

## Getting Started with the FedCG class

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.iit.it/hpc/hybrid-fed-krls.git
   cd hybrid-fed-krls

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**:
    ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install the Required Packages**:

    ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook

2. Open the Notebook:
Navigate to FedCG_usage.ipynb and run the cells. The notebook is composed of three sections:
   1. Explore datasets.
   2. Using the class.
   3. Simulations.


## EDM completion experiments
In `main.m` one can find the script used to test several EDM completion methods on different datasets, for different numbers of Nystrom landmarks, generated with different methods. Results obtained running this script on IIT HPC Franklin machine.
Results are saved in the three datasets directories (`Ionosphere/`, `Iris/`, `Sonar/`). The summary plots presented in the paper have been derived form these results with the script `plotMultiErrors.m`.
EDM completion methods `alternating_descent.m` and `rank_complete_edm.m` used in `EDM_tests/` are taken from [[2]](#2). Method `spectralReconstruction.m` is an implementation of Algorithm 1 from [[3]](#3).
